Exploring Spring Framework Basics
*Spring Framework Overview*:

Spring is a lightweight, open-source framework simplifies Java development, particularly in building enterprise applications.
Its core concept is dependency injection (DI), which decouples objects and promotes loose coupling, making code easier to test and maintain.
Key Components:

Beans: Objects managed by the Spring container. Beans are created, initialized, and managed within the Spring IoC container.
Configuration: Defines how Spring beans are created and wired together, usually via XML or Java annotations (@Configuration, @Bean).
Dependency Injection: Spring manages object dependencies by automatically injecting required objects (beans) into the dependent objects, allowing better separation of concerns.
Benefits of Spring:

Loose coupling and testability via dependency injection.
Modular design, allowing you to use only the parts of Spring you need.
Simplifies enterprise application development, including data access, transaction management, and web applications.
